Here's the full, refined version of your plan:

Day 1-2: Dataset and Initial Exploration

-   Download and load the dataset using appropriate Python libraries
-   Explain the purpose of the report
-   Provide a summary of the dataset
-   Display first few rows of the dataset
-   Describe observations and analyze dataset attributes (shape, data types, etc.)

Day 3-4: Data Pre-processing

-   Identify columns with missing values
-   Decide how to handle missing values and justify the choice
-   Use appropriate methods to fill in missing values
-   Check for duplicate rows in the dataset
-   Describe observations and decide whether to keep or remove duplicate rows, with justification
-   Identify potential outliers using both statistical (including skewness calculation and interpretation) and visualization methods
-   Create scatter plots for outliers/non-outliers (at least one in report, rest in appendix)
-   Decide whether to keep, remove, or transform outliers, with justification
-   Choose and justify the correct method for handling outliers (zscore vs IQR)

Day 5-6: Data Visualization

-   Calculate basic summary statistics for numerical columns
-   Explain findings from summary statistics
-   Create visualizations for numerical data distribution (boxplot or histogram with KDE)
-   Create visualizations for categorical data distribution (bar plot or pie plot)
-   Ensure proper labeling, titles, and legends for all plots
-   Include at least two plots in the report and the rest in the appendix for both numerical and categorical data
-   Clearly explain all provided plots

Day 7-8: Multivariate Analysis (Part 1)

-   Perform correlation analysis for all numerical attributes
-   Visualize correlations using correlation matrix/plots
-   Provide overall explanation of correlation plot
-   Explain at least 3 distinct examples from the correlation analysis
-   Begin multivariate analysis by selecting two rational categorical variables and the 'count' variable
-   Create first plot summarizing 'count' values within each category

Day 9-10: Multivariate Analysis (Part 2) and Aggregation

-   Complete multivariate analysis with second plot summarizing 'count' values
-   Ensure plots have appropriate titles, legends, and labels
-   Clearly explain findings from multivariate analysis
-   Perform aggregation analysis (Mean and Median) for the 'count' column
-   Provide results in both tabular and graphical format
-   Analyze 'season' effect on 'count' using appropriate plot
-   Discuss two significances of performing the season-count analysis

Day 11: Conclusion and Report Finalization

-   Summarize key findings and insights gained from the EDA process
-   Discuss challenges faced during the analysis and how they were addressed
-   Suggest at least two possible next steps for further analysis or data preprocessing
-   Review and finalize report presentation (Title, Full Name, Student ID, Table of Contents)
-   Create List of Figures/Tables
-   Ensure all figures and tables have informative labels and captions
-   Check that the report is presented in a clear and concise manner
-   You might want to explicitly mention checking for skewness when identifying outliers, as this is specifically mentioned in the marking criteria.

Day 12: Final Review and Submission

-   Double-check that all requirements are met
-   Ensure code is clean, well-organized, and properly commented
-   Verify that the code is ready to execute without errors
-   Prepare separate files for code (Python Notebook or Code File) and report (PDF Format)
-   Final proofread of the report
-   Submit both files as per instructions

This refined plan covers all the specific requirements mentioned in the assignment, ensuring a comprehensive approach to completing the task.
